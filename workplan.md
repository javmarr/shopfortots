# Name of the project

Shop for Tots

# Description

This is a civic-minded project to create a wishlist management system for toy drives,
to maintain a list of approved toys, and offer a method for supporters to donate toward
the purchase of those toys (think wedding registry for toy donations). It will test UI, database,
payment gateway (API), and data management.

# Explain any risks

*All projects have risks. Outline/explain things that may prevent you from finishing. Be critical of yourself, resources, and others.*

Risk are designing the user interface can be more time consuming than planned. To mitigate, we will implement minimal interface to demonstrate functionality. We may have trouble setting up the API for
payment, say if documentation is poor or no javascript/node wrapper, so will look at more
than one option if we have trouble.


# Plan of action

*Outline each step, and estimate how much time in hours each step will take.*

Joel - implementation of payment gateway for donations, peer review, back-end work/input as needed.

Javier - scraping content, database work.

Sam - UI, algorithm for totalling wishlist contents, database models.
